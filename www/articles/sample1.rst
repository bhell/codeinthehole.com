This is the main article title

This is an introductory paragraph including some inline code: ``./manage.py syncdb``.  Now
some more text to see how this works out.

Here is an extended codeblock::

    import os
    import sys

    class DavesClass(object):
        """
        Here is a docblock
        """
        a = 10
        b = 'person'

And now some more text.  

Here's a quote:

    I want to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of Oz
