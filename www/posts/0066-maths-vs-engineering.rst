`Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs`_ is full of interesting
footnotes.  Here's a good one about the Fermat test for prime numbers:

.. _`Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs 

    Numbers that fool the Fermat test are called *Carmichael numbers*, and
    little is known about them other than that they are extremely rare.  There
    255 Carmichael below 100,000,000.  The smallest few are 561, 1105, 1729,
    2465, 2821 and 6601.  In testing primality of very large numbers chosen at
    random, the chance of stumbling upon a value that fools the Fermat test is
    less than the chance that cosmic radiation will cause the computer to make
    an error in carrying out a correct algorithm.  Considering an algorithm to
    be inadequate for the first reason but not for the second illustrates the
    difference between mathematics and engineering.
