The slides are written in `Eric Meyer's S5`_, which is a XHTML, CSS and Javascript
based slide show format. I enjoyed using this as it was easy to port my styles
across from the website CSS file, it also means the presentation is viewable as
a normal webpage (no flash required). However, the downside is that it is not
easy to submit the slides to Slideshare which is the common thing to do. There
are a few work-arounds out there but nothing good enough that I could find.
